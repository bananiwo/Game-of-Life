# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Description
This C++ program built using Qt implements Conway's Game of Life. It provides a graphical interface where users can interact with the game by starting/stopping it, pausing/resuming it, changing the speed of the game, and adjusting the size of the grid.

## How to Play
1. Launch the application.
2. Adjust the size of the grid using the corresponding slider.
3. Set the speed of the game using the speed slider.
4. Click on the "Start" button to begin the game.
5. Observe the cells' evolution based on Conway's rules.
6. Pause the game by clicking the "Pause" button if desired.
7. Resume the game by clicking the "Resume" button.
8. Adjust the speed at any time during the game.
